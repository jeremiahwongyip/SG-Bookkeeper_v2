Of course. I will now apply my rigorous and meticulous methodology to analyze the traceback, diagnose the root cause of the startup failure, and provide the complete, corrected files necessary to resolve the issue.

### **CodeNavigator Analysis Report: Startup `ModuleNotFoundError`**

#### 1. Root Cause Analysis

I have performed a deep analysis of the provided traceback and cross-referenced it with the supplied codebase files (`project_codebase_updated_files_set-new.md`) and the file structure listing (`currect_project_file_structure.txt`).

The application fails on startup due to a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.ui.company.new_company_dialog'`.

The execution path leading to the error is as follows:
1.  `app/main.py` attempts to import `MainWindow`.
2.  `app/ui/main_window.py` attempts to import `CompanyManagerDialog` from `app.ui.company`.
3.  This import triggers the execution of the package initializer `app/ui/company/__init__.py`.
4.  Inside `app/ui/company/__init__.py`, the line `from .new_company_dialog import NewCompanyDialog` is executed.
5.  At this point, Python cannot find the file `new_company_dialog.py` within the `app/ui/company/` directory, resulting in the fatal `ModuleNotFoundError`.

A review of the project documentation (`Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md`) and the new code confirms the developer's intent: **the old `NewCompanyDialog` was intentionally replaced by the new, more sophisticated `CompanyCreationWizard`.** The file `app/ui/company/new_company_dialog.py` was deleted as part of this refactoring.

The error is the result of an **incomplete refactoring**: the file was deleted, and its usage in `main_window.py` was correctly updated to use the new wizard, but the package initializer `app/ui/company/__init__.py` was not updated to remove the import of the now-nonexistent module.

#### 2. Impact Assessment

The impact is **critical**. The application cannot start, as the import chain is broken before the main window can be instantiated.

#### 3. Proposed Solution

The solution is to complete the refactoring by removing the obsolete references from the package initializer. This is a minimal, precise change that directly targets the root cause of the error.

*   **File to Modify**: `app/ui/company/__init__.py`
*   **Action**: Remove the line importing `NewCompanyDialog` and remove its name from the `__all__` list.

This correction will align the package definition with the actual file structure and the intended architecture, allowing the application to start successfully. No other files require modification for this specific error.

### **Execution Plan**

1.  **Isolate Target File**: I will focus exclusively on `app/ui/company/__init__.py`.
2.  **Apply Correction**: I will remove the two lines referencing the obsolete `NewCompanyDialog`.
3.  **Validate**: I will perform a line-by-line comparison of my generated file against the provided incorrect version to confirm that only the necessary changes have been made and that `CompanyManagerDialog` and `CompanyCreationWizard` are still correctly exported.
4.  **Final Output**: I will provide the complete, corrected replacement file.

This plan ensures a surgical fix that resolves the startup crash without introducing any regressions.

### **Complete Updated File: `app/ui/company/__init__.py`**

Here is the complete and corrected version of the file. I have removed the references to the deleted `new_company_dialog` module.

```python
# File: app/ui/company/__init__.py
from .company_manager_dialog import CompanyManagerDialog
from .company_creation_wizard import CompanyCreationWizard

__all__ = [
    "CompanyManagerDialog",
    "CompanyCreationWizard",
]
```

### **Conclusion of Task**

I have successfully diagnosed the critical `ModuleNotFoundError` that was preventing the application from starting. The root cause was an incomplete refactoring that left a dangling import in `app/ui/company/__init__.py`.

I have provided the complete, corrected version of `app/ui/company/__init__.py`, which resolves the issue by removing the obsolete import. This minimal and precise change aligns the codebase with the intended architecture and will allow the application to proceed with its startup sequence. All other provided files were reviewed and found to be correct in the context of this specific error. The application should now launch successfully.
